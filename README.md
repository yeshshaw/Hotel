# 🏨 Hotel Reservation System + 📚 Library Management System (Java)

This is a combined Java project that demonstrates the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) through two real-life use cases:
1. **Hotel Room Reservation**
2. **Library Book Management**

Both modules are built using core Java and are perfect for learning encapsulation, classes, objects, inner classes, and basic file operations.
